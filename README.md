# Railworks-ReShade
My Reshade Config for Railworks (Train Simulator 201x)

#Installation

- Install ReShade https://reshade.me/ (Pro Tip: Railworks uses DirectX 9)

- Download MartinsEffects.ini and put it into the same folder as Railworks.exe

- You may have to change RESHADE_DEPTH_INPUT_IS_REVERSED to 0 in the ReShade settings (not the config file!).
